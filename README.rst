toggl-python-api-client
=======================

`Toggl <http://toggl.com>`__ is an "insanely simple time tracking"
service.

This specific library is a Python-based REST client to interface with
the Toggle API utilizing
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__.

This library is a pure api client to help other python apps interface
with Toggl. I created this project primarily to help with a bigger
internal project that I am doing at work while at the same time getting
my feet wet in Python.

Others out there
================

There is already a similar library,
`toggl\_target <https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target>`__ though it
is more of an application and the client api is not separate repo. Some
ideas/concepts on the client api were taken from there but I had needed
a client api only to help interface with my bigger app.

Usage
=====

Pypi Package
------------

::

    pip install python-toggl

Manual installation
-------------------

Download to a location of your choice and do the following.

.. code:: python


    from toggl-python-api-client.api_client import TogglClientApi

    settings = {
        'token': 'xxx',
        'user_agent': 'your app name'
    }
    toggle_client = TogglClientApi(settings)

    response = toggle_client.get_workspaces()

Dependencies
============

-  Python 2.7 onwards
-  `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__

Tests Dependencies
------------------

To run the tests, you will need the following packages

-  unittest
-  json
-  `httpretty <https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty>`__

Tests
=====

Tests created under ``/tests`` are primarily integration tests and are
not strictly unit tests. They consists of an offline and online(live)
test.

Offline
-------

``tests/tests_offline.py``

These tests are for the logic of the api client. They do not connect to
the actual Toggl servers - instead use
`httpretty <https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty>`__ to mock the
responses. Sample responses are included in ``tests/json_responses`` and
are based on Toggle responses for V8 of the main api and V2 of the
report api.

Online/Live
-----------

``tests/tests_live.py``

These tests are to check the connections to Toggl's API and to ensure
that the client is handling the live responses from Toggl as expected.

To avoid adding sensitive data to version control, no api credentials
have been included. To enable live tests, - make a copy of
``tests/tests_live_config.json.sample`` as
``tests/tests_live_config.json`` - update the settings on
``tests/tests_live_config.json`` as needed
